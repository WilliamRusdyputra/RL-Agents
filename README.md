# RL-Agents

Various of Reinforcement Learning agents implemented using Python and Tensorflow 2. Tested on OpenAI Gym environments.
Repository was made because without implementing RL agents by myself, it is hard to grasp how the algorithms really work

Current agents that are available:
  - REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) -- done, tested on cart pole with average reward 500
  - DQN (Deep Q-Networks) --on progress to be tested on atari breakout environment
  - A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) --on progress to be tested on mountain car continuous environment
