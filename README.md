# RL-Agents

Various of Reinforcement Learning agents implemented using Python and Tensorflow 2. Tested on OpenAI Gym environments.
Repository was made because without implementing RL agents by myself, it is hard to grasp how the algorithms really work

Current agents that are available:
  - REINFORCE (Monte Carlo Policy Gradient) [done, cart-pole with average reward 500]
  - A2C (Advantage Actor-Critic) [done, mountain car continuous with average reward 96]
  - DQN (Deep Q-Networks) [on progress]
  
These implementations only for each specific environment, I did not make these algorithms to be on abstract level to test on all environment
